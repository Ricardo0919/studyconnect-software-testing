# UX Factors

## How we ranked

We took the consolidated list of UX factors from the literature and prioritized those that most impact perception and adoption in a collaborative/academic product like ours.

The literature recommends selecting domain-relevant factors rather than using a single generic instrument.

## Core UX Factors (most → least important)
### 1) Trust / Credibility
Why it matters: without trust in data, privacy, and reliability, users won’t share or coordinate tasks.
<br>Design implication: clear policies, reliable sync status, change traceability, solid uptime, and transparent error handling.
<br>Theoretical basis: explicitly listed in the consolidated UX factors; critical in domains with information exchange.
<br>Example: A website shows a padlock icon with “Connection is secure,” a clear privacy policy link, and a visible “last backup: today 12:00” note.

### 2) Helpfulness / Usefulness / Relevance
Why: if it doesn’t solve real needs (organizing work, deadlines, roles), other attributes won’t compensate.
<br>Implication: “what should I do now?” views, smart reminders, academic task templates.
<br>Basis: “Helpfulness” and “Relevance” appear as central pragmatic factors.
<br>Example: A dashboard highlights “Next actions” at the top and hides low-priority info until you expand it.

### 3) Learnability / Clarity
Why: students should get started “without a tutorial.” Low barriers accelerate adoption.
<br>Implication: task-based onboarding, in-context micro-hints, consistent language.
<br>Basis: among the most frequent factors in the usability questionnaires reviewed.
<br>Example: First use shows a 3-step guided tour with one-sentence tips and a “Skip” option; buttons use plain labels like “Save” and “Cancel.”

### 4) Efficiency
Why: fast flows (create/assign/submit) increase satisfaction and reduce friction.
<br>Implication: shortcuts, bulk actions, auto-complete for courses/members, AI for dates/estimates.
<br>Basis: “Efficiency” emerges from consolidating items (e.g., minimal action/memory).
<br>Example: A command bar (Ctrl/⌘+K) lets you create an item in one step instead of opening multiple screens.

### 5) Controllability / Dependability
Why: users must feel in control (who sees what, notifications, versions) and that “it won’t fail me.”
<br>Implication: granular permissions, undo/redo, history, configurable notification policies.
<br>Basis: one of the most prevalent factors across the instruments analyzed.
<br>Example: After deleting something, the UI offers an Undo snackbar for 30 seconds; settings include clear toggles for email or push alerts.

### 6) Social Influence / Relatedness
Why: value arises in teams (progress visibility, recognition, alignment).
<br>Implication: lightweight presence (who’s online), reactions, mentions, contribution recognition.
<br>Basis: the review highlights social factors undercovered by some questionnaires—worth including.
<br>Example: You can @mention someone in a comment and they’re notified; a small avatar shows who’s currently viewing the page.

### 7) Simplicity
Why: too many options overwhelm; simple ≠ simple tasks, but a simple experience.
<br>Implication: clear visual hierarchy, sensible defaults, fewer unnecessary decisions.
<br>Basis: consolidated factor distinct from “clarity” and “efficiency.”
<br>Example: A sign-up form asks only for email and password; advanced options are hidden under “Show more.”

### 8) Intuitive Operation
Why: expected patterns and recognizable affordances reduce cognitive load.
<br>Implication: standard UI patterns, natural drag-and-drop, unambiguous iconography.
<br>Basis: present as an independent factor in the synthesis.
<br>Example: You drag items between columns to change their status; double-clicking a title lets you edit it inline.

### 9) Flexibility
Why: courses/teams work differently (Kanban vs. list; sprint- vs. course-based views).
<br>Implication: switchable views, custom fields, optional automations.
<br>Basis: captured in the consolidation to accommodate varied contexts.
<br>Example: You can switch between List, Board, and Calendar views and add one custom field if needed.

### 10) Attractiveness / Visual Aesthetics
Why: a refined design improves first impression and perceived quality (“craftsmanship”).
<br>Implication: legible typography, spacing, contrast, consistent branding.
<br>Basis: characteristic of UX questionnaires beyond pure usability.
<br>Example: Clean typography with ample spacing and consistent colors; buttons look alike across pages and pass contrast checks.
