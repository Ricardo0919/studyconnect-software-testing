# UX Factor Analysis for StudyConnect

## 1) Trust / Credibility
- Importance: Students will not coordinate or upload coursework if they doubt privacy, data integrity, or uptime. Trust is a prerequisite for sharing and planning.
- Support: Status page with uptime and “Last backup” time; clear system states (“Saved”, “Offline—retrying…”); per-item change history (who/when/what); transparent privacy policy and data handling; auditable access controls.
- Risks: Low adoption and quick churn after any incident; avoidance of sensitive uploads; reputational damage that is hard to recover.

## 2) Helpfulness / Usefulness / Relevance
- Importance: If the app doesn’t turn courses, deadlines, and roles into clear next steps, students see it as “just another list” and revert to existing tools.
- Support: Next Actions on the dashboard; due-soon highlighting; quick templates per course/project; smart defaults (auto-assign to creator, suggested due dates); timely, contextual reminders.
- Risks: Low task completion and perceived redundancy; fallback to manual workflows (chat threads, scattered docs), reducing product impact.

## 3) Learnability / Clarity
- Importance: Most users are first-timers and must reach value without reading docs; quick understanding drives team/class-level adoption.
- Support: Three-step first-run tour with Skip; consistent labels (“Save/Cancel”); one-time micro-hints shown in context when needed.
- Risks: Day-one abandonment, increased TA/teacher support load, and uneven adoption across groups.

## 4) Efficiency
- Importance: With heavy course loads, every click counts; fast flows sustain daily use and reduce friction on deadlines.
- Support: Command Bar (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to create/navigate; bulk actions (assign/complete); autocomplete for people and dates; keyboard shortcuts; one-field quick task creation with Enter to submit.
- Risks: Perception that “it takes too long,” frustration, migration to lighter tools, and time lost on repetitive operations.

## 5) Controllability / Dependability
- Importance: Users must feel in control of visibility, notifications, and recovery from mistakes; the sense that “it won’t fail me” sustains long-term trust.
- Support: Granular permissions per space/item; Undo (30s) and Version History; notification center with toggles (email/push); reliable sync with explicit conflict resolution.
- Risks: Privacy mishaps, notification fatigue, irreversible errors, and declining trust that undermines ongoing use.
